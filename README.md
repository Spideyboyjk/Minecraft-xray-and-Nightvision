I didnt create any of these i just wanted to share it with you guys. I know how hard it is to find them.

They are put in the folder that says (XRAY AND NIGHT VISION.zip) because idk how else to put it. When you click the file you have to click (view raw) and then the file will download then once the file is downloaded extract it out of the folder and put it into minecraft.

works for 1.20 and up. 

works with bedrock and mcpe. if on phone I suggest using fx launcher to import the mods.

Enjoy

Also FULL CREDIT TO THE ACTUAL PEOPLE WHO MADE THESE IDK WHO MADE THEM I GOT THEM OFF A GUY ON YOUTUBE



EXTRA HELP - if on mobile and want to download but it won't let you download go to the github site on Chrome or safari and search for this respiratory and put in desktop mode. Then you should be able to download the mods.
